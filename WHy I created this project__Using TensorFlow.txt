The reason why I created this project, 
is mainly to try it out, get my hands on it, learning something new. 
I haven't even started leraning machine learning or any related courses, 
but am currently planning on taking those. 
Another reason is that, I have a lovely girlfriend, 
and I would love to see what will she look like in two-dimensional animated world.

Hope my first project using GitHub will be finished nicely.
